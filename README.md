Problem Statment: The bank has a growing customer base. The bank wants to increase borrowers (asset
customers) base to bring in more loan business and earn more through the interest on
loans. So , the bank wants to convert the liability based customers to personal loan
customers. (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year
for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. The
department wants you to build a model that will help them identify the potential
customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase the
success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign.

Solution:I have came up with a Machine learning model which uses the details of the customers and based on the statistical summary along with the help of some ML based algorithms the model predicts whether or not to give loan to the customer.The algorithms used to predict in the model are Logistic Regression,Decision tree and KNN Classifier.
